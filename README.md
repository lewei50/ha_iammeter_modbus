This fork from [wills106](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-iammeter-modbus)
Added single-phase meter and device auto-discovery.

# homsassistant-IamMeter-modbus
IamMeter Modbus custom_component for Home Assistant
Support Modbus TCP

Firmware version >= 75.82

You can have multiple instances of this Integration, just change the default Prefix from IamMeter to something else. Ie IamMeter Main or IamMeter Garage

Supports:

- WEM3080
- WEM3080T

# IAMMETER

------

[IAMMETER](https://www.iammeter.com/) provides both a bi-directional single-phase energy meter([WEM3080](https://www.iammeter.com/products/single-phase-meter)) and a bi-directional three-phase energy monitor ([WEM3080T](https://www.iammeter.com/products/three-phase-meter)). Both of them can be integrated into Home Assistant.

## Installation

------

### Manual Installation

1. Copy `iammeter_modbus` folder into your custom_components folder in your hass configuration directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Installation with HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. Ensure that HACS is installed.
2. In HACS / Integrations /explore&download repositories/iammeter, add the url the this repository.
3. Search for and install the `iammeter` integration.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

It is configurable through config flow, meaning it will popup a dialog after adding the integration.

1. Head to Settings --> Devices & Services--> ADD INTEGRATION
2. Add new and search for `iammeter_modbus`
3. Enter a name for your meter. It suggests "IamMeter" by default, but if you plan to read multiple make it a unique name.
4. Enter a IP to the IamMeter module. For example: "192.168.2.15" .
5. SUBMIT --> FINISH.
